# Script
This is a simple shell script you can run in your Unix terminal that works on simple logic that I think is casting out nines: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting_out_nines


I saw it on Youtube and decided to try my hand because...why not :D




# Run
To run in terminal, run this command in the directory the script is saved in:

    bash game.sh
    
I formatted this script with spaces to look good in terminal, so take note.
